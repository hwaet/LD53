  narrativeText: Cruel fate hath played a twisted joke upon me. I picked up mine
    shield after a bout at the latest tourney, yet now that the dust has been cleaned
    away, I find it is not mine shield at all! I humbly beseech thou, wilt paint
    over with mine own device to remove this shame?
