  narrativeText: Take heed thou that doubtest one which hath only apprenticed for
    one week, the Earl of these lands vouches for our new Master of Livery and assures
    all that they will produce crests of impeccable quality befitting the traditions
    of our most noble houses. They shall delivereth the crest to the correct noble
    house (which hath the correct crest upon the mantle).
